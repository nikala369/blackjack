          <div class="paragrap-flex">
            <p class="paragrap-flex-1">Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also
            dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one
            card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King)
            are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to
            draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called "soft", meaning that the hand
            will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21.
            Otherwise, the hand is called "hard".</p>
            <p class="paragrap-flex-2">Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all
            players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards
            total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a "soft" 17,
            i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) You are betting that you have a better hand
            than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The
            detailed outcome of the hand follows:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="ul-style">
            <li>If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), and the dealer does not, the
            player wins and usually receives a bonus.</li>
            <li>If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.</li>
            <li>If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not, the player wins.</li>
            <li>If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust, the player wins.</li>
            <li>If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum called a "push", no one wins.</li>

        <p class="paragrap-blackjack">Blackjack, formerly also Black Jack and Vingt-Un, is the American member of a global family of banking games known as
        Twenty-One, whose relatives include the British game of Pontoon and the European game, Vingt-et-Un. It is a comparing
        card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do
        not compete against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino
        banking game in the world. <br> <br> <a class="link-wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy">Wikipedia</a></p>

      <h1 class="heading2">Basic Strategy</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="article-border">
      <p class="paragrap-blackjack">Basic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card.
         Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily 
        stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:
        It makes the player's 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).
        It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.
        However, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy 
        rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game. 
        Blackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player 
        a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or blacklisting if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows: 
        During the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:
Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.
Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.
A card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2–6, 0 points for 7–9 and −1 point for 10–A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make 
betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for "balanced" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.
Blackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%–1% when players use basic strategy.[18] Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.
Card counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly advantageous to the card counting player. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards,
 casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.
Card counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter is not using an external device, but if a casino realizes players are counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.
The use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal in all US states that license blackjack card games.<br> <br> <a class="link-wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy">Wikipedia</a></p>

    </header>
    <article class="article-border">
      <p class="paragrap-blackjack">Blackjack's immediate precursor was the English version of twenty-one called Vingt-Un, a game of unknown provenance,
         but probably of Spanish origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, most famous for writing Don Quixote.
          Cervantes was a gambler, and the main characters of his tale "Rinconete y Cortadillo", from Novelas Ejemplares, are a couple of cheats working in Seville.
           They are proficient at cheating at veintiuna (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that
            the ace values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish baraja deck. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ventiuna was played in Castile since the beginning
         of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.
        The first record of the game in France occurs in 1768[4] and in Britain during the 1770s and 1780s, but the first rules anywhere appear in Britain in 1800 under the name of Vingt-Un.
         Twenty-One appeared in the United States in the early 1800s, still known in those days as Vingt-Un. The first rules were an 1825 reprint of the 1800 English rules.
         English Vingt-Un later developed into an American variant in its own right which was renamed blackjack around 1899.
        There is a popular myth that, when Vingt-Un ("Twenty-One") was introduced into the United States in the early 1800s - other sources say during the First World War and
         still others the 1930s - gambling houses offered bonus payouts to stimulate players' interest. One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the ace of
          spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand was called a "blackjack", and it is claimed that the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn.
           French card historian, Thierry Depaulis has recently debunked this story, showing that the name Blackjack was first given to the game of American Vingt-Un by prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–99), 
           the bonus being the usual Ace and any 10-point card. Since the term 'blackjack' also refers to the mineral zincblende, which was often associated with gold or silver deposits, he suggests that the mineral name was transferred by prospectors to the top bonus in the game. He was
         unable to find any historical evidence for a special bonus for having the combination of an Ace with a black Jack.
        The first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956. Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey,
         Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.[10] This paper would become the foundation of
          future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. Ed Thorp would use Baldwin's hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book Beat the Dealer.<br> <br> <a class="link-wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy">Wikipedia</a></p>

    </header>
    <article class="article-border">
      <p class="paragrap-blackjack">"Doubling Down" redirects here. For the South Park episode, see Doubling Down (South Park).
        After receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: "hit", "stand", "double down", or "split". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, "surrender".
        Hit: Take another card from the dealer.
        Signal: Scrape cards against table (in handheld games); tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body (in games dealt face up).
        Stand: Take no more cards, also known as "stand pat", "stick", or "stay".
        Signal: Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face up).
        Double down: The player is allowed to increase the initial bet up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.
        Signal: Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.
        Split: If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.
        Signal: Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.
        Surrender (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to "surrender" directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.
        Signal: The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal.
        Hand signals are used to assist the "eye in the sky", a person or video camera located above the table and sometimes concealed behind one-way glass. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify advantage players whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence. Each hand may normally "hit" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in counterclockwise order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.<br> <br> <a class="link-wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy">Wikipedia</a></p>
